# Issues, false positives to consider, and feedback

> Keck (2006) mentions the important role that paraphrase plays in enabling writers to express the ideas of others in their own words.

> For Keck (2006), helping one writer to express the ideas of another using different words is a key feature in paraphrase.

The following phrase should have comma splices, however the parser gives a parenthetical phrase:

> However, population aging has become a problem in the 21st century, the birth rate in developed countries is dropping.

> Nowadays, most of the people with age over 65 are still healthy, we should not assume that people who aged 65 or above are unproductive.

There were fragment issues in this response. But this particular problem is of a relative clause.  The solution could have been either: 'people aged 65 or above' (no relative clause pronoun) or 'people who are aged 65 or above'.
