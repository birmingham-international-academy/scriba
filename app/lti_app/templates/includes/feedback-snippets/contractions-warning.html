<p>The following contraction forms have been found:</p>

<ul>
{% for contraction in academic_style_check.contractions %}
    <li>{{ contraction }}</li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>

<p>In spoken English we use the short form a lot. Instead of "I am" we say, "I'm". "You are" becomes "you're". "Did not" - "didn't" etc...</p>
<p>However in written academic texts it is advised to not use these short forms as they are considered informal.</p>
